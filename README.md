# leap-data_science-assignment

You've been invited to complete this data science assignment.

We have deliberately designed this assignment to be open-ended in order to leave plenty of room for you to make choices.

Please document your code. We do not expect you to spend days on this nor to build a full-blown application.

Good luck!

# Assignment

In this repository you'll find a data directory with files containing energy meter-data.

Each row corresponds to a meter and time interval, and shows the
energy consumed and energy generated, or curtailed, in units of
watt-hours.

Please build a solution that does the following:

Part I:
Produce a table showing the mean energy, total energy, and total generation in kilowatt-hours for each meter in calendar month between Jan 2020 to April 2021.

Part II:
Using any simple model of your choice, forecast the total generation during each month from May - August 2021.

Please provide your code and results of this assignment.

_BONUS_ if the following are included:

- In production, this solution would be used on millions of rows -- the solution is scalable.

- If the code is written in PySpark please only use native PySpark (No UDFs or UDAFs please).


We are looking forward to your solution!
